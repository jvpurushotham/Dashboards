Actionable Insights for Organizational HR Strategy:

High Attrition Alert:
With an attrition rate of 33.4%, nearly 1 in 3 employees is expected to leave the organization. This suggests the need for deeper analysis into exit reasons, job satisfaction, and retention strategies.
Workforce Demographics:
The average employee age is 46.41 years, and over 80% of the workforce is aged 36 and above. This indicates a mature and experienced team, but also a potential risk of future retirements and succession planning needs.
Departmental Dynamics:
Production and IT/IS departments have the highest headcounts. Targeted retention programs in these departments could significantly reduce overall attrition impact.
Recruitment Sources Efficiency:
Most hires are sourced from Indeed and LinkedIn, showing the effectiveness of online recruitment. However, employee referrals and job fairs are underutilized and may be improved to diversify hiring channels.
Salary & Retention Link:
Departments like Executive Office and Software Engineering, which offer higher average salaries, show lower attrition. This correlation suggests that competitive compensation may enhance employee retention.
Attrition Trend Monitoring:
Yearly termination and attrition trends reveal fluctuations that can be tied to salary dissatisfaction or career stagnation. Regular trend analysis can help predict and mitigate future turnover spikes.
